# Advanced Statistical Tests and Evaluating the Null

In this session, we'll cover more advanced statistical tests, such as multifactorial experiments (e.g. multifactorial ANOVA, multiple regression), and experiments with factors of more than 2 levels. 

Additionally, we'll cover how to evaluate evidence in support of the null using the Neyman-Pearson framework.

Content to follow.

## Multifactorial Analyses

### Multifactorial ANOVA

What if we want to conduct a multifactorial (e.g. two-way) ANOVA? Below, we'll look at some data by which we want to evaluate the main effects of two conditions, and the interaction between them on some depdendent variable. 

### Mixed ANOVA

### Multiple Regression

## Evaluating Evidence for the Null

Here, we will look at equivalence tests. Content to follow.
